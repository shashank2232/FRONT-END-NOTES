THE DRUM KIT:
--> FUNCTIONS TAKING OTHER FUNCTIONS AS INPUT & RETURNING THE ANSWER
function add(num1,num2){
return num1 + num2;
}
function multiply(num1,num2){
return num1 * num2;
}
function calculator(num1,num2,operator){
return operator(num1,num2);
}
The function calculator has 3 parameters, 1st 2 are numbers & 3rd is the function we want to call.

calculator(2,3,add);           // gives 5
calculator(2,3,multiply);      // gives 6

NOTE: Functions that take other functions as inputs are called HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS.

--> PLAYING SOUND USING JS
var audio = new Audio("sounds/tom-1.mp3");
audio.play(); 
Here we are creating an audio element in our JS file to link the sound file, and when we click on the button,the sound plays.

/* TO ATTACH IMAGE TO BACKGROUND USING CSS */
.w {
  background-image: url("images/tom1.png");
}

--> THIS keyword is used to get the property OR code of the element we click on.
this.style.color = "white";        (by this,when we click on a element/button it's color will become white)

--> OBJECTS IN JS
var bellBoy1 = {
name = "johnny",
age : 19,
hasWorkPermit = true,
languages : ["English","French"]
}
Here bellBoy1 is an OBJECT & name,age etc. are its PROPERTIES.

bellBoy1.name;    // . is used by object to access a property
alert("Hello,my name is " + bellBoy1.name);

--> CONSTRUCTORS IN JS (names have to be capital,i.e. the first letter)
function BellBoy (name, age, hasWorkPermit, languages){
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
this.hasWorkPermit = hasWorkPermit;
this.languages = languages;
}

Initialising OBJECTS via this Constructor:
var bellBoy1 = new BellBoy("Timmy",19,true,["English","French"]);
(DOT . is used while using the PROPERTY or calling the METHOD which have() that properties don't have)
--> SWITCH STATEMENTS IN JS
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}

--> USING KEYBOARD EVENT LISTENERS TO CHECK FOR KEY PRESSES (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keypress_event)
// by this,if we tap on keys of our keyboard,an alert will pop-up on screen with the message, "keypress" is used for this thing
document.addEventListener("keypress",function(){
    alert("KEY WAS PRESSED!");
});

// DETECTING KEYBOARD PRESS
document.addEventListener("keypress",function(event){
    makeSound(event.key);
});

function makeSound(key){
    switch (key) {
        case "w":
            var tom1 = new Audio("sounds/tom-1.mp3");
            tom1.play();
            break;

        case "a":
            var tom2 = new Audio("sounds/tom-2.mp3");
            tom2.play();
            break;

        case "s":
            var tom3 = new Audio("sounds/tom-3.mp3");
            tom3.play();
            break;

        case "d":
            var tom4 = new Audio("sounds/tom-4.mp3");
            tom4.play();
            break;

        case "j":
            var snare = new Audio("sounds/snare.mp3");
            snare.play();
            break;

        case "k":
            var crash = new Audio("sounds/crash.mp3");
            crash.play();
            break;

        case "l":
            var kick = new Audio("sounds/kick-bass.mp3");
            kick.play();
            break;

        default: console.log(buttonInnerHTML)
    }
}

We'll simply call function makeSound(buttonInnerHTML) .

--> TYPES OF FUNCTIONS:
1) HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS (functions that take other functions as inputs)
2) CALLBACK FUNCTIONS (functions that get passed in inputs of higher order functions)
