A FRONT-END LIBRARY (Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.)
Usually for designing of websites. It is RESPONSIVE(it responds to the view-port i.e. mobile or laptop , website changes its design depending on where it's displayed)

-> WEBSITE TO PRACTICE: (codeply.com)
   Eg: <button class="btn btn-primary">HELLO WORLD</button>    (this will display HELLO WORLD in a BLUE BUTTON)
    <button class="btn btn-dark">HELLO WORLD</button>    (this will display HELLO WORLD in a DARK BUTTON)

    BOOTSTRAP has a bunch of classes that are styled for users.

   CDN (A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
   A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. 
   The popularity of CDN services continues to grow, and today the majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon.)

    OR YOU CAN SIMPLY DOWNLOAD THE CSS AND JS SOURCE CODE (then simply include them into ur website)

-> WEB DESIGNING (WIRE-FRAMING means setting up the design first)
   To create some wireframes using pencil & paper (sneakpeekit.com)  OR (balsamiq.com)
   WEBSITE FOR SOME DESIGN-PATTERNS (ui-patterns.com)  
   Another website where designers put some designs (dribble.com)

-> NAVIGATION BAR :
   <nav class="navbar">
    <ul class="navbar-nav">
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="">CONTACT</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
   </nav>
   THIS WILL MAKE A CONTACT LINK WHICH WHEN WE TAKE OUR CURSOR ON IT,WILL HOVER.(by this way all links will be vertically placed)

   TO MAKE ALL LINKS HORIZONTALLY PLACE SIDE BY SIDE:
   <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-dark">                    // navbar-expand-lg will make them horizontally placed (bg-dark will give them a dark bg)
    <ul class="navbar-nav">
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="">CONTACT</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="">PRICING</a>

        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="">DOWNLOAD</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  (FOR DESIGNING ALL THE NAVBAR, WE SIMPLY USE ITS CLASS navbar)

   <ul class="navbar-nav ms-auto">
